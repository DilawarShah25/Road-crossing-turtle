**Concepts Used:**

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The game is structured using object-oriented programming principles. Each game element, such as the player, cars, and scoreboard, is represented as an object with its own properties and behaviors.

2. **Turtle Graphics:** The game utilizes the Turtle module for graphics rendering and interaction. Turtles are used to represent game elements such as the player and cars, and methods like `forward()`, `backward()`, and `goto()` are employed for movement.

3. **Randomization:** Randomization is used to spawn cars at random intervals and positions on the screen, creating varied gameplay experiences for each session.

4. **Event Handling:** The game responds to user input using event handling. The player can control the turtle character using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

5. **Collision Detection:** The game implements collision detection to determine if the player's turtle collides with any of the oncoming cars. If a collision occurs, the game ends, and a "GAME OVER!" message is displayed.

6. **Level Progression:** The game features level progression, with the player advancing to higher levels upon successfully crossing the road. As the player progresses, the speed and number of cars increase, making the game more challenging.

**How to Play:**

1. Run the Python script `main.py`.
2. Use the up arrow key to move the turtle character upwards, navigating it across the road.
3. Avoid colliding with oncoming cars by maneuvering the turtle carefully.
4. Successfully cross the road to advance to higher levels.
5. If the turtle collides with a car, the game ends, and a "GAME OVER!" message is displayed.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (included in Python standard library)

**Files:**

- `main.py`: Contains the main game loop and initialization code.
- `player.py`: Defines the Player class, representing the player's turtle character.
- `car_manager.py`: Defines the CarManager class, responsible for spawning and managing cars.
- `scoreboard.py`: Defines the Scoreboard class, displaying the player's current level and end-of-game messages.

**Acknowledgements:**

The "Road Crossing Turtle" game is inspired by classic arcade games like Frogger. Special thanks to the creators and contributors of the Turtle module for providing a fun and educational way to explore programming concepts through interactive graphics.
